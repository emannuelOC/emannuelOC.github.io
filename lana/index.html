<h1>Lana</h1>

<h2>Some history</h2>

<p>
	Lana is a project I've thinking about and working on since 2013 (it's been almost 5 years now). 
	Since then, the ideas about the app have changed a lot. It all started when I joined the 
	Apple Developer Academy, and we were told that, at some point in the future, we'd have to choose
	a "Big Idea" to work on and I decided I wanted to create an app about brain health.
</p>
<h3>2013/2014: Proto-Lana</h3>
<p>
	At first, it was supposed to be a 
	sort of helper for speech therapists to work with aphasia patients, so they could use less 
	paper.
</p>
<h3>2015: Mobility</h3>
<p>
	Then, as the project evolved, I noticed it could be more and I considered adding the functionality
	to allow patients to exercise at home and let the doctors track their progress.
</p>
<h3>2016: Personalization</h3>
<p>
	As time went by I noticed that the tests and exercises were "one-size-fits-all" solutions and 
	patients - specially neurological patients - had very idiossyncratic needs. So I decided Lana
	should allow doctors and therapists to customize the tests and exercises according to each
	patient's needs.
</p>
<h3>2017: Sleep</h3>
<p>
	For some unclear reasons, in 2017 I didn't work on Lana as much as I could and the ideas I had
	about it were quietly asleep. During that year I've learned a lot both on iOS development and
	Machine Learning. And that allowed me to come up with a new idea.
</p>
<h3>2018: Intelligent Assistent</h3>
<p>
	Now, I'm rewriting Lana from scratch, only this time it's supposed to be a very different app.
	It still has the advantages of <i>mobility</i> and <i>personalization</i>, but now it is 
	somewhat proactive.
</p>
<h4>The app</h4>
<p>
	In this new concept, the user will receive a notification (a message) every morning, remininding
	him/her about their daily exercises. Then, as he opens the app, it will look like a chat, where
	he will interact with <i>Lana</i>, answering questions, drawing things, typing, speaking, standing,
	walking, etc. for five minutes.
	The app will track the patients score and when it notices some alterations, cognitive or otherwise,
	it will let the appointed doctor know, so he/she can create a custom test for the patient or even
	call him/her up in the chat or personaly to check their health.
</p>
<h4>Monetization</h4>
<p>
	Lana's main clients aren't the patients or doctors anymore. Now we will focus on health insurance
	companies and hospitals, whose main value out of the app will be to detect neurological diseases
	earlier so they can be treated early, reducing the expenses with the treatment.
</p>
<p>
	My clients will be able to offer discounts for patients who are willing to take five minutes of
	their days to "talk to Lana" and have their brain health checked continually.
</p>
<h4>Go to market</h4>
<p>
	I'm not the best person with deadlines, but I'm trying to get better on this. So, I wanna write
	down some important dates for Lana:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>February 28 (today): Start new version of the app</li>
	<li>March 28: Have an MVP (iOS) and show it to possible clients</li>
	<li>April 28: Have the Android version of the MVP and improve the iOS to start testing</li>
	<li>May 28: Start negotiations for at least one contract</li>
	<li>June 28: Have our first client and look for investors</li>
</ul>
