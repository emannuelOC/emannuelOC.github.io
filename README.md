# Redesign

## What the website should have:
* [ ] Resum√© (GET from a lambda at AWS?)
* [ ] Portfolio
* [ ] Learning
* [ ] Contact information
* [ ] Links to posts (Medium)
* [ ] Fun (music, Franguilongo, drawing, writing, etc) -- other site maybe?
* [ ] Theology -- other site maybe?

## How it should look:
* [ ] Dark theme (like the temrinal, or sublime)
* [ ] White with colors (like 2017 WWDC)
* [ ] Dark with pictures as background
* [ ] Fun with flat design illustrations
